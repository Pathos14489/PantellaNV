This repository is for the PantellaNV mod, which handles the FalloutNV-side logic of Pantella. For the main Pantella repository, see [here](https://github.com/Pathos14489/Pantella).

The source code for the subtitles plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/swwu/Mantella-Subtitles-Plugin-NG).

# How to Install

I do not recommend manually installing the mod, instead please use the [launcher](https://github.com/Pathos14489/Pantella-Launcher). However if you must, all the scripts on this repo are precompiled, merely download by clcking the Code button, then Download ZIP. The zip downloaded will contain the mod plugin. Install it using your mod manager of choice.
